# Minesweeper
A minesweeper implementation in HTML / CSS / JS.

See [Minesweeper.info](www.minesweeper.info/wiki/Windows_Minesweeper "Minesweeper.info") for more information on Minesweeper.

This is by no means the cleanest or most efficient minesweeper implementation, though it was fun to make.
Thanks to Emmett M. for extracting the game sprites.
